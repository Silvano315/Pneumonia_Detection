# Pneumonia_Detection
This project aims to study a public dataset on pneumonia detection based on a binary classification problem. I will perform a preprocessing phase, create a deep learning model from scratch, evaluate it with a transfer learning technique and complete this study with a grad cam integration.

Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
It is composed by three main folders: train, test, val. Each of them contains two folders: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. In [images](images/) there are just few examples to see the images I used. You can find the entire dataset at the Kaggle link.
